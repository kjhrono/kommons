# Changelog

All notable changes to the kommons shell are documented here. The format
loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the
versioning intent is [semver](https://semver.org/) — while the package is
pre-1.0, minor versions carry the features.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-23

The lobby grows a proper front door, invites go visual, and email
registration proves the address. Everything below is backwards-compatible
for hosts: existing `SharedLobbyStep` call sites keep working unchanged.

### Added

- **Lobby entry chooser** (`SharedLobbyEntry`) — the shared NEW-GAME
  landing: proposes the persisted player's name (editable, persisted) and
  offers SINGLE-PLAYER (the game's own screen) and MULTI-PLAYER (the seat
  lobby) doors.
- **Open seats** — ADD SEAT opens a roster slot advertised as
  "SEAT X — open" instead of asking a name; tapping it claims the seat
  through a name dialog. JOIN GAME stays disabled until every promised
  seat is claimed. Up to 8 seats; removing a slot renumbers the rest.
- **Scan-to-join** (`scanInviteWithCamera`) — a camera QR scanner in the
  lobby beside the paste button, over `mobile_scanner`, feeding the same
  invite codec; swappable `scanInviteExecutor` seam for tests and hosts.
- **Signup-confirmation links** — the emailed `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`
  (`type=signup`) link is recognized by the shell's link watcher and
  completes a parked registration automatically (both `token_hash` and
  fragment-token generations); `confirmation_link.dart` parser,
  `AuthService.verifySignupTokenHash`, `completeSignupConfirmationLink`.
- **Provider grant story in settings** — the sign-in line names the
  provider, and GitHub sessions carry the note that grants must be
  revoked at github.com.
- `verify_consumers.sh --list` — prints the registered consumer gates.

### Changed

- The language picker always shows the effective language pre-selected
  (unset resolves to English), and re-tapping the selected entry persists
  it — previously a first visit showed nothing selected and tapping the
  apparent selection did nothing.
- The probe (HERALD) routes NEW GAME through the entry chooser and reads
  as a proper example game.

### Fixed

- OAuth session restore no longer drops the "popup closed" early-return;
  a stale flush guard no longer blocks per-game preference pushes.

### Operators

- `docs/OAUTH_SERVER_SETUP.md` explains why registrations may "sign in
  asap" (`GOTRUE_MAILER_AUTOCONFIRM=true`) and documents the
  confirm-signup template options alongside the recovery template notes.
